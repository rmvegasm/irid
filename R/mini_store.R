#' Mini-store projection over a record
#'
#' Builds a `reactiveStore`-shaped callable tree that projects a single
#' record out of a parent collection. Reads route through `get_record()`;
#' writes (whole-record or per-field synthetic setters) route through
#' `set_record()`. The mini-store never owns the record's state -- the
#' parent collection is the single source of truth.
#'
#' Used by `Each` (record items) and `Match` (record bound value) to
#' project fine-grained leaf reactivity out of a coarse-grained parent.
#'
#' Recursive -- nested named lists in the initial record become sub-mini-stores
#' (so `mini$user$name(v)` writes through the same chain as
#' `mini$user(<full-user>)` would).
#' Each level threads a sub-`get`/`set` pair down the tree; writes at any
#' depth fan out through the chain of synthetic setters until they reach
#' the user-supplied `set_record`. Shape uses the same shared
#' branch-vs-leaf rules as [reactiveStore()] (`is_branch`, `is_bare_list`,
#' `strip_asis` are reused), and the same recursive `validate_write()`
#' enforces "no unknown keys, no missing keys" at every level on
#' whole-record writes.
#'
#' **Shape is strict.** Writes are validated against the keys captured
#' at construction -- same contract as a [reactiveStore()] branch.
#' Callers that need to change a slot's shape reshape the *parent
#' collection* directly (e.g. for `Each(items, ...)`, write the new
#' `items()` with the slot already replaced); the outer reconciler
#' observes the parent change and rebuilds this mini-store with a
#' fresh leaf tree of the new shape on the same flush.
#'
#' **Writes replace, like [reactiveStore()].** A branch write must
#' include every locked key; missing keys are an error. The complete
#' record is what reaches `set_record`. Per-field writes
#' (`mini$field(v)`) remain the dedicated single-slot path -- use them
#' when you want to update one field without naming the rest. Dropping
#' a field is a parent-level operation: write the reshaped collection
#' through the source callable (`items(...)`) and the outer reconciler
#' rebuilds.
#'
#' Internally, every leaf holds a `reactiveVal` kept in sync with the
#' parent by a single root-level propagating observer. The observer
#' walks the tree top-down via each branch's internal `set_internal`,
#' which recurses to children's `set_internal`; only at leaves does an
#' actual `reactiveVal` write occur, gated by `identical(old, new)`.
#' This is what delivers the "only changed fields fire" promise -- the
#' diff happens inside the projection rather than at the call site, so
#' callers can't get it wrong.
#'
#' @param get_record A 0-arg reactive callable that returns the current
#'   record (a fully named list).
#' @param set_record A 1-arg function called with the new record on
#'   whole-record write or after a per-field synthetic setter has built
#'   the complete record.
#' @param scope A scope from [make_scope()]. The propagating observer is
#'   created against `scope$session` and registered for cleanup so
#'   `scope$destroy()` tears it down.
#' @return A callable with class `c("reactiveStore", "reactive", "function")`,
#'   shaped like a `reactiveStore` branch -- `mini()` reads the record,
#'   `mini(record)` writes it, `mini$field()` reads a leaf or sub-branch,
#'   and `mini$field(v)` writes through the parent.
